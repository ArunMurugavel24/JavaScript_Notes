// DOM - Document Object Model
// Use to manipulate and select elements from HTML in Javascript to Manipulate

// DOM Traversal - moving through DOM to find the appropriate elements to Manipulate

// document - a keyword used to point the entire web page
// We have various selectors to select html elements to manipulate
// Some of them are:
// 1. querySelector, 2. getElementById ...

// When you wanted to retrive the style of an element which is already present, you can use either "getComputedStyle" with "window" object or "style" with "document" object. ("getComputedStyle" gives an array as the result, whereas, "style" does not)

// 'querySelector' is a JQuery way of selecting and Element that grabs that particular element completely (can be used for grabbing any element using classes, IDs, elements, etc) (Widely used in the developer community)
